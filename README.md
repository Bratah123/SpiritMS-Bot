# SpiritMS-Bot
Discord bot that SpiritMS Server used, coded by Brandon Nguyen. Works with swordie sources if you add some of the functions. 
Not meant to be used, for viewing purposes.

If you do use it, you'll need to import some dependencies via Maven.

https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA for Discord Bot
https://github.com/MinnDevelopment/discord-webhooks/ for webhooks

Any questions on set up or any errors can be asked by dming me on discord Not Brandon#4444 c: P.S. I don't claim to be a good dev, just something fun.
